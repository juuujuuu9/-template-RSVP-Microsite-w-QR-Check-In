# Rule Update System

Use inline annotations to manage the evolution of this project's standards.

| Annotation | When to use |
|------------|-------------|
| `// RULE-CANDIDATE: [description]` | Pattern repeats 3+ times. |
| `// RULE-QUESTION: [id]` | A rule feels outdated or hinders speed. |
| `// RULE-VIOLATION: [id] Reason: [text] Expires: [date]` | Intentional technical debt. |

Example:
```ts
// RULE-VIOLATION: RULE-001 Reason: Legacy API returns untyped JSON. Expires: 2025-06-01
const data = response as Record<string, unknown>;
```
